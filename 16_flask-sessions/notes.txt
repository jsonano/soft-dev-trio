Plan:
* import Flask, request, session
* hard-code a dictionary with a preset username and password
* on the Flask webpage, create three user entries for the username, password, and submit button
* if the username and password are correct, load a new webpage
* whenever initial page is loaded, attempt to fetch the cookie, and if it exists, load a new webpage

DISCO:
* from flask import redirect --> redirect(route) sends a user to the route
