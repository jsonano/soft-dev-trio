CONVERSATION 1
We prompted Copilot with the Scenario One directions word for word.
Response
 1. Returned a "high-level plan", similar to our design document, to complete the project.
 2. Provided numerous files in TypeScript (.ts) for user auth, story management, database handling, and the actual server (which accesses MongoDB).
 Note: While Copilot did create the files and functions, there is no actual code inside said functions. Only a comment saying what the function does.


CONVERSATION 2
Told Copilot to create a Flask App using only Python and HTML instead of TS.
Enabled Copilot to search the Web for its response.
Response 1
 1. Returned a "Project Structure" in the form of a file tree.
 2. Began outputting files "run.py", "config.py", and "app/__init__.py".
 3. The tab unexpectedly crashed when opening the files in the browser.
 Note: There was a notification titled "1 vulnerability detected", stating that "embedding credentials in source code risks unauthorized access". We do not know if this caused the crash.
Response 2
 Note: Reiterated the same instructions.
 1. Returned the SAME Project Structure.
 2. Returned files listed in the Project Structure, EXCEPT for "user_stories.html". In addition, files "run.py", "config.py", and "app/__init__.py" were marked as V2, while the ones in the previous response were marked as V1. There is no difference between the two versions, except in "__init__.py" where the code got cut off from the crash.
 3.
