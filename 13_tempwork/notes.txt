DISCO:
 - HTML template placeholders can be utilized practically anywhere, as long as the syntax is correct.

EGO:
I agree with the main points of this excerpt. It is natural for most programmers to miss glaring bugs in their programs.
That demonstrates the importance of collaboration with and revision by other fellow programmers. In the previous section of the article,
it states that most programmers are socially detached, and I somewhat embody this fact. It is much easier to focus and program
when alone. However, in the end, it is detrimental to our work. The easiest and most efficient way to debug is for another person to 
help, and in the end, you can learn from their revisions. 

QCC: (these are the same questions my group had)
- Is there a "most optimal" way to do this?
- Is there a way to use if statements or other more traditional code writing practices?
- What is the code in the "{%...%}"? Is this some kind of notation that puts Python on the inside? We assume not, since
  the "{% endfor %}" is not part of Python. If not, then what coding language is this? Where can we find a reference for this?
  Should we expect to use this on higher levels than a for-loop in the future?
