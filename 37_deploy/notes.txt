1. Installing
 - sudo apt update
 - sudo apt install ...
 Notes:
  - At the end of installation, there was a screen asking for confirmation to load a new, updated kernel and restart services.

2. Python Env
 - sudo apt install python3-venv
 - mkdir ~/myproject
 - cd ~/myproject
 - python3.10 -m venv myprojectenv
 - source myprojectenv/bin/activate

3. Flask
 - pip install wheel
 - pip install uwsgi Flask
 - nano ~/myproject/myproject.py
 Notes:
  - uWSGI is an open source software application that "aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services" - Wikipedia
  - Installation of uwsgi and Flask took about a minute.
  - app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
  - Flask provides two IP addresses: 127.0.0.01:5000 and [droplet_IP]:5000. Only the droplet IP works.

4. uWSGI
 - MUST create a WSGI entry point: wsgi.py
 - Without this file, the server will return an "Internal Server Error".
 - Create uWSGI config file: myproject.ini

5. systemd
 - Tutorial uses username "sammy". MUST replace with your droplet username.

6. Config NGINX
